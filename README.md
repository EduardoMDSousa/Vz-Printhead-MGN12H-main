The Vz-Printhead Printed Version

The Vz-Printhead is a light weight and stiff head made for the VzBoTs, with MGN12H on X Axis. It was designed to be compatible with almost all hotends, and extruders out there. With the height adjustable fan duct, you can easily change your config without having to re-print a new fan duct.
